.SH NAME
fzf - a command-line fuzzy finder

.SH SYNOPSIS
fzf [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS Search mode
.TP
.B "-x, --extended"
Extended-search mode
.TP
.B "-e, --extended-exact"
Extended-search mode (exact match)
.TP
.B "-i"
Case-insensitive match (default: smart-case match)
.TP
.B "+i"
Case-sensitive match
.TP
.BI "-n, --nth=" "N[,..]"
Comma-separated list of field index expressions for limiting search scope.
See \fBFIELD INDEX EXPRESSION\fR for details.
.TP
.BI "--with-nth=" "N[,..]"
Transform each item using index expressions within finder
.TP
.BI "-d, --delimiter=" "STR"
Field delimiter regex for \fB--nth\fR and \fB--with-nth\fR (default: AWK-style)
.SS Search result
.TP
.B "-s, --sort=MAX"
Maximum number of matched items to sort (default: 1000)
.TP
.B "+s, --no-sort"
Do not sort the result
.TP
.B "--tac"
Reverse the order of the input
.RS
e.g. \fBhistory | fzf --tac --no-sort\fR
.RE
.SS Interface

.B "-m, --multi"
Enable multi-select with tab/shift-tab
.TP
.B "--no-mouse"

Start the finder with the given query
.TP
.B "-1, --select-1"
Automatically select the only match
.TP
.B "-0, --exit-0"
Exit immediately when there's no match
.TP
.BI "-f, --filter=" "STR"
Filter mode. Do not start interactive finder. When used with \fB--no-sort\fR,
fzf becomes a fuzzy-version of grep.
.TP
.B "--print-query"
Print query as the first line
.TP
.RS
e.g. \fBfzf --multi | fzf --sync\fR
.RE

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND
Default command to use when input is tty
.TP
.B FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS
Default options. e.g. \fB--extended +i\fR

.SH EXIT STATUS
.BR 0 "      Normal exit"
.br
.BR 1 "      Interrupted with \fBCTRL-C\fR or \fBESC\fR"

.SH FIELD INDEX EXPRESSION

A field index expression can be a non-zero integer or a range expression
([BEGIN]..[END]). \fB--nth\fR and \fB--with-nth\fR take a comma-separated list
of field index expressions.

.SS Examples
.BR 1 "      The 1st field"
.br
.BR 2 "      The 2nd field"
.br
.BR -1 "     The last field"
.br
.BR -2 "     The 2nd to last field"
.br
.BR 3..5 "   From the 3rd field to the 5th field"
.br
.BR 2.. "    From the 2nd field to the last field"
.br
.BR ..-3 "   From the 1st field to the 3rd to the last field"
.br
.BR .. "     All the fields"
.br

.SH EXTENDED SEARCH MODE

With \fI-x\fR or \fI--extended\fR option, fzf will start in "extended-search
mode". In this mode, you can specify multiple patterns delimited by spaces,
such as: \fB'wild ^music .mp3$ sbtrkt !rmx\fR

.SS Exact-match (quoted)
A term that is prefixed by a single-quote character (\fB'\fR) is interpreted as
an "exact-match" (or "non-fuzzy") term. fzf will search for the exact
occurrences of the string.

.SS Anchored-match
A term can be prefixed by \fB^\fR, or suffixed by \fB$\fR to become an
anchored-match term. Then fzf will search for the items that start with or end
with the given string. An anchored-match term is also an exact-match term.

.SS Negation
If a term is prefixed by \fB!\fR, fzf will exclude the items that satisfy the
term from the result.

.SS Extended-exact mode
If you don't prefer fuzzy matching and do not wish to "quote" (prefixing with
\fB'\fR) every word, start fzf with \fB-e\fR or \fB--extended-exact\fR option. Note that
when \fB--extended-exact\fR is set, \fB'\fR-prefix "unquotes" the term.
(instead of \fI-x\fR or \fI--extended\fR).
